# Problem
## a friend who recently moved to Toronto, has decided to open a restaurant of Venezuelan food in Toronto.

## The most important questions you have are:

## Is there a relevant Hispanic community in Toronto with an appetite for this type of flavors?

## What would be the most effective neighborhood to open the restaurant, considering the flow of people and close to places of relevance?
